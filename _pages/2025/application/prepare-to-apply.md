            We will invite candidates to attend the V(S)SS’12 as official students. It means the application is highly competitive. Therefore, please carefully read our instructions to prepare your application, and submit your application on time (no late application is accepted for any reason). An assessment committee reviews all profiles to grade the merit and suitableness of each applicant, and only top candidates are selected to attend the summer school. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            The summer school opens free of charge for all selected students. The students who complete all the courses and lectures will be conferred a certificate by the school committee. There will have a grant for some official students, who are far from the V(S)SS’12 location and are in financial difficulty, selected to award a travel and/or accommodation scholarship.
