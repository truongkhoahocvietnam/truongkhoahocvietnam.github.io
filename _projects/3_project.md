<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size:18px;font-weight:bold">Brief Description of the Project Concept</p>
This project leverages IoT technology to improve aquaculture sustainability. It aims to develop an IoT-based system for real-time water quality monitoring, measuring parameters like temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen. By continuously collecting and analyzing data, the system will enable proactive management of aquaculture conditions. Additionally, the project seeks to use IoT data to identify and reduce sources of marine pollution from aquaculture operations. Strategies will focus on optimizing resource use and implementing eco-friendly practices to minimize nutrient runoff and waste.
