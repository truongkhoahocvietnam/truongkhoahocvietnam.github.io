# Main activities:
- Studies of Hadoop MapReduce platforms in relation to traffic generation in datacenter networks
- Design of methods for optimizing the performance of co-flow completion time (CCT) and analysis of observed performance
- Implementation of complex test cases to verify the proposed solutions
- Design online learning methods for identifying co-flows and combine them with co-flows scheduling order
- Set up distributed algorithms for resource allocation
- Collaboration with research engineers to carry out research activities on simulation and emulation platforms
