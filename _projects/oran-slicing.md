The ongoing digitalization of industrial tasks, services and businesses is enabled by seamless and ubiquitous smart wireless connectivity. Emerging applications and services in 6G networks give rise to exponential growth in both volume and variety of the data traffic. Moreover, various system controls, robotics and smart traffic machine-type communications (MTC) applications forming the tactile Internet, in turn, call for synergistic integration of new services and intelligence to wireless networks. This can be done by using open access radio network (O-RAN) integrating network slicing (NS) and edge computing (EC) with resilience awareness.

This project will investigate distributed EC approaches in O-RAN that encompass existing ones while addressing the above challenges and adding different levels of intelligence. This enables truly distributed intelligence, converting the wireless network to a low power computer, wherein the nodes perform reasoning, inference and networked artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), often with essentially “zero” latency. Specifically, the project aims to: 
1. formalize a detailed multi-layer optimization framework and corresponding methodologies for joint computation and communication strategies in generalized resilience-aware EC for O-RAN;
2. develop innovative learning algorithms uniquely tailored towards large-scale O-RAN systems based on the proposed resilience-aware EC framework;
3. develop novel network slicing solutions to enhance network flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. Precisely, the proposed solutions will address the problems of dynamically optimizing virtual resources among network slices that share a common O-RAN infrastructure.
The proposed framework is expected to achieve the highest level of self-adaptation and sustainable networks and capture network uncertainties and interplays between the physical and higher layers within O-RAN Alliance architecture. This can be done by leveraging emerging technologies such as EC and NS; and powerful tools such as optimization theory and AI/ML.
